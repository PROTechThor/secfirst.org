      <p>We recommend you use a password.

We haven’t made this compulsory in case you weren’t storing much, but we think you’re better safe than sorry. You are entirely responsible for all activities that occur through use of your password, even if another person was using your account at the relevant time. We are not responsible for any losses or liabilities arising out of or in connection with any unauthorised use of the App. </p>

Once we have received your anonymised information, we will use procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. </p>
