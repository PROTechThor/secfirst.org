## Content

We warmly welcome corrections that will improve Umbrella content. Reach out at any time through our secure contact form [email] (info@secfirst.org).  
We’re also designing a collaborative [workflow] (https://iilab.github.io/contentascode/) to help you submit corrections. If you already use Github, you can open a new issue directly on our [content repo] (https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_content/issues).  

## Test

We are always looking for people to test and quality assure our app. Drop us a mail if you can help. (info@secfirst.org)
Translate
Umbrella is being translated into more than a dozen languages, and you can help.

1. Create a free account with [Transifex] (https://www.transifex.com/). 
2. Click [Help Translate Umbrella App] (https://www.transifex.com/otf/umbrella-app/). 
3. Choose your language and translate something. Even a single sentence helps! 

The awesome [Localization Lab] (http://www.localizationlab.org) manage volunteer translators for Umbrella. If you are an organisation, the fastest way to see Umbrella in your language is to donate money for us to hire a translator. Thank you!
