      <h2>Why Choose Security First</h2>
      <p>Security First offers a unique perspective on security.</p>
      <p>Our staff combine military, technology, and human rights experience. We have developed and implemented security solutions for NGOs, aid organisations and media groups in some of the world’s most inhospitable environments. USAID cited the thirty-five module training program developed by Security First CEO Rory Byrne as the industry-leading standard. It’s the basis for our free Android app, Umbrella.</p>
      <p>But what we understand best is people. We’ve trained hundreds of them. And we know that you can have all the information in the world at your fingertips (hi, Google!) and still have trouble acting on it without a little help.</p>
      <p>We also know the best training won’t work if you don’t implement what you learn. You forget. Things change. Your adversaries evolve.</p>
      <p>So we design trainings that make it easier for you to stay secure, for good.</p>

        <p>If you’re not in the market for a group training, we welcome individuals to our open training sessions held in London, UK. We also make everything we know available for free. You can download and share Umbrella, and even deploy your own security manual in an app using our mobile CMS, Tent.</p>  
        <p>But if you want to get safety off your to-do list and make it a reality, get in touch. We’ll design a training that your team will really use to stay secure in the office and in the field. Request a quote.
