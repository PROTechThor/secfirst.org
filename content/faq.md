			<h3 class="green">Should I use a password with Umbrella? Can I reset it? </h3>
			<p>If you want to save your checklists and keep an eye on your progress, we recommend you use a strong password. If someone gets their hands on your phone, you don’t want them to review your security protocols. We haven’t made this compulsory in case you weren’t storing much, but we think you’re better safe than sorry.</p>
			<p>Anything you input into Umbrella is only stored on your device. We can’t see it or give it to anyone else. We also can’t recover your data if you accidently delete it or forget your password.</p>
