# Umbrella User Manual

## About

Umbrella is an all-in-one app developed by Security First for digital and physical security. 
It provides information on what to do in any given security situation and the tools to do it. 
Umbrella is designed for and used by journalists, aid workers, human rights activists, and people travelling in high-risk areas. 

Umbrella allows the user to choose what they want to do, such as: protect data; securely make a call/email; securely access the internet; plan secure travel; protect their office/home; conduct counter-surveillance; or deal with kidnapping, arrest or evacuation. Once a situation is chosen, the app outlines what to do and what tools to use given your circumstances. This is followed by a simple checklist of recommended actions that can be customised, saved and shared securely. Umbrella’s Feed also provides users with an up-to-the-minute account of potential risks in their chosen location.

### Umbrella Web

The web version of Umbrella is available at [umbrella.secfirst.org](https://umbrella.secfirst.org/).

## Running Umbrella for the first time

The first time you run the Umbrella app, you will see a set of screens showcasing some of Umbrella's features. 
The final screen shows you a summarized version of Umbrella's **Terms and Conditions**. 
Read through the **Terms and Conditions** and accept them to proceed.

![Accept Umbrella Terms and Conditions](/imgs/manual/accept-terms.png)

A popup appears asking you to download more content. 
Umbrella has lots of lessons and contents, some of which need to be downloaded so that they work offline. 
Tap **OK** to download more content. 

![Download additional content](/imgs/manual/download-more-content.png)

After the content is done downloading, choose what security guide you need most, or explore on your own if you prefer. 

![Download additional content](/imgs/manual/what-do-you-need-most.png)

After making any selection, you should now have access to Umbrella's content. 
At this point, Umbrella will prompt you to set up a password. 
Your password must be at least 8 characters long and must contain at least one digit and one capital letter. 
After entering and confirming your password, tap **OK** to proceed. 
Once you have set a password, you will be prompted to enter it every time you open the Umbrella app. 

Alternatively, you may decide to skip the password setting step. 
Note that doing this significantly diminishes your safety in regards with any identifiable data you input into Umbrella. 

When you set a password, you will be prompted to enter it every time you launch the Umbrella app. 

![Password prompt](/imgs/manual/password-prompt.png)

## Feeds

The feeds dashboard contains security feeds from places like the UN Relief Web and the US Centers for Disease Control. You enter your location (and how often you want to be updated) and whenever a new update is released (e.g a disease outbreak in your location), the information comes up on the dashboard.

### Feed

The Feed keeps you up to date with the current risks in your area, helping you monitor local threats with live security alerts from trusted sources. 
The content you see on your feed depends on the country and sources you set. 

To begin setting your feed, click on the **Set Now** button, under the **Set your feed** card. 

![Set your feed](/imgs/manual/set-feed.png)

A popup appears, requesting for an interval. 
The interval determines how often your feed will be updated with new content from the source(s). 
Enter your preferred interval in minutes and tap **OK** to continue. 

![Enter feed interval](/imgs/manual/enter-interval.png)

Next, enter a location and tap **OK**. 
You will only get alerts related to the location (country) you pick. 
There is no geolocation or tracking of your input location. 
We can’t see it, and neither can anyone else.

![Enter feed location](/imgs/manual/enter-location.png)

Finally, select your preferred feed sources and tap **OK**. The sources you select will determine the nature of the content in your feed. 

Below are the sources that Umbrella currently includes for real-time updated security feeds. For privacy reasons, users never connect directly to these services. More useful sources that will help users keep updated on the move will be added with time.

- [ReliefWeb / UN](http://reliefweb.int): excellent physical security updates that amalgamate information from the UN and various NGOs - though not available in every country
- [Foreign and Commonwealth Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office): foreign travel advice, consular help, and services abroad and document legislation
- [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov): updates on disease and health warnings
- [Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System](http://www.gdacs.org): updates on natural disaster issues such as floods, earthquakes, and tsunamis
- [US State Department Country Warnings](https://www.state.gov/travel/): updates mainly focused on the security situation for travellers and internationals - available for every country

![Select feed sources](/imgs/manual/select-feed-sources.png)

That's it. Your feed should now be populated with content, ordered by the newest content first.

![Feed populated with alerts](/imgs/manual/sample-feed.png)

Tapping on the feed card will open a page with more information about the event, directly in the Umbrella app. 

You may change your feed location, interval, and feed sources at any time, using the **Set** buttons under their respective sections. 

![Set Interval, location and feed sources](/imgs/manual/set-interval-location-source.png)

### RSS

RSS feeds show you recently-posted content from blogs and websites you choose to follow. 
While a Feed is dependent on location and specific sources, an RSS feed shows all new content from any website. 
You are encouraged to add your own RSS feeds for customised updates. 

Navigate to the **RSS** tab of the feed page. 
By default, Umbrella provides RSS feeds from popular news websites like BBC and Threadpost.

![Default RSS websites](/imgs/manual/default-rss.png)

Click on a source to see the RSS feed from that website. 

To add more RSS feeds, tap the plus icon (**+**) at the bottom right of the RSS screen.

![Add new RSS feed](/imgs/manual/add-rsss.png)

Then, enter a link to the RSS feed into the **Feed Source** field, then tap **OK**. 

![Enter RSS feed source](/imgs/manual/rss-feed-source.png)

For each post on the RSS feed, you can share using the **Share** button or view more information using the **Learn More** button. You may read the full post without even leaving the Umbrella app.

## Forms

Forms enable you to compile secure itineraries and protocols, which can be shared with your team. 

Forms allow a user to quickly fill out and share important information about issues such as their travel plan in a high-risk location or report on a digital/physical security incident.

### Filling a form

Tap on the  **Forms** tab from the bottom navigation menu to visit the forms page. 
Umbrella provides four default forms, and they can be filled as many times as you want. 

Any information you input into a form in Umbrella is encrypted. That means we can’t see it, and it will stay private if you use a strong password. (Go to **Set Password** under **Account** option in the navigation menu. To learn about strong passwords, read the *Information* --> *Passwords* lesson in Umbrella). 
Forms are not encrypted when you share it by email, but should be reasonably secure if the person you’re sharing it with has a strong password and uses two-factor authentication (the *Passwords* lesson has more information about two-factor authentication). However, if you want to input really sensitive information, like credit card details, read the *Information* --> *Protecting Files*, and *Information* --> *Safely Deleting* lessons and think carefully about the risks of unauthorized access before exporting the form.

![Available forms](/imgs/manual/forms.png)

#### Physical Security Incident

The Physical Security Incident prompts you to report a physical security event, such as a robbery or kidnapping.

6. **Motive:** What do you think is the motive of the perpetrators? Did they want money or something else? 
7. **Reporting the Incident:** If you have reported the incident to someone, mention this. Did you call the police or anyone else?
8. **Security Guidelines:** Note if any security guidelines were followed during the incident.
9. **Guidelines Revision:** Do the security guidelines or any other aspect of security management need to be revised to prevent similar incidents in the future? If yes, what sort of revisions do you think should be made?

13. **Evidence:** Have you saved any evidence (screenshots, error messages, emails, files) that show that the incident occurred?
14. **Reflection:** Think back on how the incident happened. Is there anything you can change to prevent a similar incident from happening in the future?
15. **Next steps:** Note actions that you need someone else to take to resolve the incident. 
16. **Anything else** Get creative. Challenge yourself to write something you haven’t already mentioned here.

Tap on any of the available forms to begin filling it. The information you're required to fill in depends on the type of form. 

Enter information into the fields and tap on **Next** to proceed to the next section of the form. You can also go back to edit your previous answers with the **Back** button. As you complete a form, a percentage indicates how far you have gone.

![Filling a form](/imgs/manual/fill-form.png)

You can exit a form anytime by tapping on the back arrow icon at the top left of the screen. Umbrella automatically saves how far you've gone. Once you have started filling a form, it is shown on the Forms page, under the **Filled our forms** section. You may edit it, share it, or delete it by tapping on the appropriate icon. 

![Filled out forms](/imgs/manual/filled-out-forms.png)

The same form can be filled multiple times. 

**Note**: Since forms ask for personally-identifiable information, it is advisable to [set up a password](/umbrella-manual/#set-password) for Umbrella app, to prevent unauthorized people who may have your device from accessing your data.

![Logout](/imgs/manual/logout.png)

## Make Umbrella work for you

Imagine we have a security manager called **K**. K is running a team spread across three countries. Staff have various levels of training — in some cases, none at all. 
Risk levels vary, from sources who require total anonymity, to an office administrator with no field experience and limited digital expertise beyond Microsoft Office. Here are some different ways for K to make use of Umbrella:

| Option | Description | Cost |
| --- | ----------- | ----|
| _Adapt_ | Download Umbrella | Free |
| _Customize_ | Build your own security app | Developer skills required |
| _White Label_ | Secure app for your brand/content | Request a quote|

### Adapt Umbrella

Umbrella was designed to meet the needs of people from different sectors operating at various levels of risk. 

To adapt Umbrella for the needs of the team, K should: 

- Point team members towards the most appropriate lessons and tool guides. 
- Warn of any deviation from existing policies to avoid confusion. 
- Take mitigating action if having Umbrella on a particular device could increase risk.
- Review legal and insurance requirements for security or duty of care to incorporate Umbrella.
- Umbrella should complement and streamline K’s security strategy. It can’t replace a proactive security manager. 

### Customise Umbrella with Tent

K wants to put existing policies in a secure app. 
K has a technical background and a colleague in IT who’s up for a challenge.
They build their own version of Umbrella at minimal cost using open-source tools, including Security First’s mobile CMS, [Tent](/tent/).

Tent contains all the tools you need to create, edit, and publish securely-under one roof.

### White label Umbrella with Tent
K’s boss can contract Security First to white label Umbrella with the organisation’s own brand and content — no technical background required.

Request more details or a quote at [info@secfirst.org](mailto:info@secfirst.org).
