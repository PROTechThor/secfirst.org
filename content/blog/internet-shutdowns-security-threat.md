[Umbrella](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.secfirst.umbrella), our free, open-source Android app (currently in BETA), compiles comprehensive security advice for people at risk. This month we're adding information on Internet shutdowns. 

Shutdowns are a serious security threat. They happen during times of unrest or uncertainty. They strip you of trustworthy information about what's going on, and the ability to communicate securely. And they affect everyone in the area, however vulnerable. 

In other words, shutdowns can compromise your digital and your physical security all at once. Yet many governments implement them frequently and deliberately. 

## What are Internet shutdowns?

*	Officials may order a company to turn off mobile data so no-one can access the Internet from their phone. 
*  Home Internet, phone service, and SMS messaging functions can be shut down too, or slowed until they're basically useless. 
*  Specific social media services can also be blocked to shut down to stop people from sharing information.
*  Criminals may also seek to attack telecommunications companies or damage cables to disrupt Internet service. 

### Why?

The reasons given vary. Officials may say they're trying to stop protect people from being attacked at public events, or prevent rumours or illegal information from spreading. 

(If they believe that, they're misinformed. Inconveniencing potential criminals isn't a good reason for shutdowns, which studies [show](https://cihr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2015-09-Telenor-Pakistan-Case-Study.pdf) have major economic and social repercussions. As for rumours, if you shut down the Internet, you also shut down anyone willing to help you tell the truth.) 

Many actors involved in implementing shutdowns don't bother to give a reason, or issue orders behind closed doors. 

That's because shutdowns aren't about safety and security. Like other forms of censorship, Internet shutdowns are about control.  

### Where?     

Shutdowns are happening more often around the world, with incidents increasing every year since 2015, according to the [*Freedom on the Net 2017*](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/freedom-net-2017) report by Freedom House and #KeepItOn, a global coalition convened by Access Now that fights shutdowns. (I worked on the Freedom on the Net project until January 2018.)

### When?

Elections, protests, festivals, anniversaries of a meaningful event, or outbreaks of violence are all possible triggers for an Internet shutdown. In these cases, shutdowns will hinder your work and likely contribute further to instability.  

Some shutdowns are not connected with unrest, but could still undermine your operations. Many countries have implemented them to prevent cheating on exams, including Algeria in June 2018, according to the [*Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/algeria-shuts-internet-prevent-cheating-school-exams) and other news reports.

## Shutdowns and security

A lot of security advice involves keeping very sensitive *information* offline. But if *you* are the one who's offline, the situation changes completely.   

People can be at risk because of something they do, like activists, journalists, or aid workers. Someone female or LGBT may be at risk because of who they are. Either way, using a phone and going online can expose you to threats and heighten your risk. Your adversaries may seek to suppress you with censorship, or to find you and cause you harm. 

So circumventing censorship and staying anonymous online are necessary security measures for many. (The "Internet" chapters in Umbrella compile advice from EFF's [Surveillance Self-Defense](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-circumvent-online-censorship) and [Security in a Box](https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/anonymity-and-circumvention) by Tactical Tech and Front Line Defenders, with a few updates and cuts to make them friendlier for small screens.) 

If you're dealing with a social media shutdown, or your messaging app is blocked, follow that advice and use a tool like [Psiphon](https://psiphon.ca/) or the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) to circumvent censorship. 

### But what if you can't get online at all? 

Being denied Internet access is a security game changer, because of the reasons authorities shut down service in the first place.  

If you're organising or covering a protest, the security advice we quote in Umbrella is to go in a team and stay in close touch. 

But protests are exactly the kind of event that trigger shutdowns. If you're using an app like Signal to encrypt messages to your team, you're out of luck.  

There are other issues. Even if you can still contact emergency services, you may not be able to access basic health and safety information in a hurry, or get the latest news and security advisaries. 

(One of the reasons we're building Umbrella is to put that information on your phone when you need it, including custom RSS feeds. Did we mention that it's [free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.secfirst.umbrella), open source, and we need people to test it out?) 

### Shutdowns and people at risk

Shutdowns can change the dynamics on the streets. People out and about may be frustrated, operating on limited or false information, or just bored and looking for trouble. 

People who may aready be vulnerable, such as members of a persecuted ethnic or religious minority group, should be aware that these conditions can heighten their risk.      

Arshie Qureshi is a gender-focused social worker based in Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir, a state which has seen more shutdowns than any other in India. In her experience, she says, shutdowns can be particularly problematic for women.     

"Internet shutdowns happen in tense situations in response to killing or any form of disturbance," she told me. "In such situations, men find themselves not constrained as they can go out, interact with others. A woman going out in such conditions attracts a lot of attention and public scrutiny."   

(Arshie Qureshi was extremely professional when I reached out to her, responding quickly to let me know that another shutdown would delay her more detailed reply by several hours. Her tips for continuing to work during a shutdown are included in part two of this series, "What to do when the Internet is shut down.")

## Write a shutdown policy

If you manage security or operations for an NGO, you may need guidelines on shutdowns for team members in certain countries.
