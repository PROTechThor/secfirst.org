# How to manage security using a free app, Umbrella

You do security. It might say so in your job title, or it might not. You might not even have a job title. But if you’re making decisions about a team of people—where they work, how they get there, how they communicate—and you’re trying to keep them safe, we need your help. 
We’re security people ourselves. We face the same problems you do when it comes to managing team security. 

We set out to solve them with our free, open-source Android,  and iOS and web app, Umbrella. It contains the latest security advice, plus a range of new features to help you manage a team and their information. 
Now we need to test them. We want your team to use Umbrella and let us know how it’s going, so that we can make it better. 


**Get Umbrella from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.secfirst.umbrella), [iOS Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/umbrella-security/id1453715310), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Security-First-Umbrella-made-easy/dp/B01AKN9M1Y), [F-Droid](https://secfirst.org/fdroid/repo/?fingerprint=39EB57052F8D684514176819D1645F6A0A7BD943DBC31AB101949006AC0BC228) or use the [online web app](https://umbrella.secfirst.org).**

## 3. MAKE UMBRELLA WORK FOR YOU.

K is running a team spread across three countries. Staff have various levels of training—in some cases, none at all. Risk levels vary, from sources who require total anonymity, to an office administrator with no field experience and limited digital expertise beyond Microsoft Office. Here are some different ways for K to make use of Umbrella. 

### i. Adapt Umbrella

<div class="img-fluid float-left">
    <img src="/imgs/tent-logo.png" alt="">
</div>

Umbrella was designed to meet the needs of people from different sectors operating at various levels of risk. 
To adapt Umbrella for the needs of the team, K should: 

- Point team members towards the most appropriate lessons and tool guides. 
Warn of any deviation from existing policies to avoid confusion.

- Take mitigating action if having Umbrella on a particular device could increase risk.
- Review legal and insurance requirements for security or duty of care to incorporate Umbrella.

Umbrella should complement and streamline K’s security strategy. It can’t replace a proactive security manager. Umbrella offers advice on what to do in risky situations. The advice may not always apply and you should consider all potential risks, use a wide range of advice, and use your own judgement. [See our full terms of service](https://secfirst.org/legal). 

### ii. Customise Umbrella with Tent
K wants to put existing policies in a secure app.  K has a technical background and a colleague in IT who’s up for a challenge. They build their own version of Umbrella at minimal cost using open-source tools, including Security First’s mobile CMS, [Tent](https://secfirst.org/tent/).

### iii. White label Umbrella with Tent
K’s manager contracts Security First to white label Umbrella with the organisation’s own brand and content—no technical background required.
