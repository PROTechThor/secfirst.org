# Dear friend,

We are writing to you because you signed-up for more information about Security First. We have been busy over the past few months working away on developing our first test version and because you kindly showed an early interest in our work – you will be getting a sneak preview before we show-case our full version to everyone else at the RightsCon Conference in San Francisco in March. We have tried to make it look as unlike most security tools as possible (i.e.: boring and complicated) so here it is (we hope you like it!):

We decided to tackle what we see as one of the first parts of the security problem, planning and risk assessment – to help users mitigate threats before they even occur. Our first version currently allows you to pick from a wide range of security scenarios, from arranging a secure meeting to conducting counter-surveillance and sending a secure mail. The app provides users with the most up-to-date information and advanced security methodologies available. They can also easily implement these through the use of the checklists for each task. These are customisable, so people can fit best practice with their reality on the ground. Users can also increase the security of others by sharing these security checklists with colleagues or across their organisation.

Once we get back from RightsCon, we would love to get feedback from some of you early test users. We will also start to look at building more interactivity into the planning process. If your interested in our full development plan for the app – feel free to take a peak here.

With everyone volunteering on this project our current capacity is limited. If you want to help us save lives, know more, contribute (funding, time, skills) or connect us to others please drop me a mail to rory@secfirst.org

All the best,
Rory

**P.S** The currently version is still very much in a testing phase and lacks many of the features and development time that would be necessary before we would be happy to let human rights defenders on the ground use it. Please treat it as such and only use it for testing!
