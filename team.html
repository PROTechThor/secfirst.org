				<h4>Rory Byrne: Co-founder and CEO</h4>
				<p>Rory founded Security First in 2012. His experience draws from over eight years in the human rights world, and also from his work in the military, in Westminster, and as a Certified Ethical Hacker. From a teenager in MIT Media Lab Europe to his role as the Head of Security & Research at Videre – Rory has a strong track record of identifying human rights problems and implementing solutions through the efficient use of technology. Previously he helped establish the human rights organisation, Videre – the world leader in the gathering, verification and distribution of covert camera footage. He successfully developed and trained hundreds of HRDs in a thirty-five module training program in areas as varied as encryption, counter-surveillance, covert filming, risk management and secure communications – cited by USAID as the industry leading standard. As someone who has spent the past five years working to protect high-risk HRDs, Rory is now developing the tool he wishes he had had.</p>
